# Setup on Windows 10

The following instructions are designed to help get you up and running with Windows 10 PC for development
in CSCI 1302. The majority of the time, you will not be developing directly on your PC. Instead,
you will use your PC to connect to a remote server via a terminal emulator. Once connected, the
commands that you type and the programs that you run will be executed on the remote server instead
of on your local machine.

## Install MobaXterm

For Windows 10, we recommend the use of a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
called [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).
